# Dataspace Protocol Best Practices


## Abstract

This document presents best practices for the usage of the Dataspace Protocol.

## Status of this document

The Best Practices are created and published by the International Data Spaces Association and are not considered to be normative. The specification of the Dataspace Protocol itself is normative. As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.

The key words *MAY*, *MUST*, and *MUST NOT* in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Introduction

The Dataspace Protocol is under development and the working group is active on this draft. We have reviewed and improved the content multiple times. During the process several aspects were discussed, which are not considered to be part of the specification itself, but important to be documented as support for the users of this specification as best practices. The examples in this document are non-normative.
